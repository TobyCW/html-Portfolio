<h1>The Best Movies According to Toby</h1>
<h2>My Top 5 Movies</h2>


<hr />

<h3>Prisoners</h3>
<p>A dark and disturbing movie with a very well written story and multiple twists making predicting what happens impossible.<br />
It kept me on the edge of my seat through the whole movie and is one of the best movies I have seen.
</p>
<h3>Byousoku 5 Centimeter (5 Centimeters per second)</h3>
<p>A love story split into three parts, which looks at relationships with how they can change with distance and time and how it is important to let go.<br />
This is one of my favourites due to how different it is to regular romance movies, with the two not meeting together in the end.
</p>
<h3>Koe no Katachi (A Silent Voice)
</h3>
<p>A romance/drama movie which covers themes such as bully, self isolation and suicide. The main bulk of this movie focuses on the main character trying to make amends for his previous actions. <br />
This is an emotional rollarcoaster of a movie which made cry by the end. </p>
<h3>Stand by Me</h3>
<p>An adventure thriller following along four friends who go to look for the dead body of a missing boy, this is based on a book by Stephen King. <br />
This is one of my favourite movies due to it's deep themes and it's ability of creating nostalgia even though it is set in a time which I did not experience. 
</p>
<h3>Joker</h3>
<p>A psychological drama/thriller which portrays mental illness through the character of Arthur Fleck. It explores issues within society through this Batman Villians origin story. <br />
This is one of my favourite movies as it is dark and gritty whilst also being comedic, I enjoyed this movie all the way through and would recommend watching this. </p>
